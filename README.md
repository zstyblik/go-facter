# go-facter

go-facter is a loose implementation of Puppet Labs [facter] in golang. The main target are platforms where there isn't possible or feasible to install Ruby, eg. [CoreOS]. Also, you can run it in Docker Container and still get data from the Host itself.

In theory, go-facter can be used as a library of sort to build custom facts.
